This project has been divided in three notebooks: the "5fold" notebook, containing 9 experiments ran using 5-fold cross validation on 3 different architectures, the "PreCrossValidationTraining" notebook, which reports 19 training experiments on 9 different network architectures, and "Visualization", an additional notebook where images and network structures are visualized. No training experiments is contained in this last notebook. Since the "PreCrossValidationTraining" notebook contains the experiments conducted to select a subset of models to use for training with 5-fold cross-validation, the "5fold" notebook, which responds to the necessity of the work having a more limited running time, can be run indipendently. The project has been conducted in Google Colab, and all notebooks contain a direct Colab badge.
