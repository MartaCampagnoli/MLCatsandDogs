This project has been divided in three notebooks: the "5fold" notebook, containing 9 experiments ran using 5-fold cross validation on 3 different architectures, the "PreCrossValidationTraining" notebook reports 19 training experiments on 9 different network architectures, and " " is an additional notebook where images and network structures are visualized. Since the "PreCrossValidationTraining" notebook contains the experiments conducted to select a subset of models to use for training with 5-fold cross-validation, the "5fold" notebook, which responds to the necessity of the work having a more limited running time, can be run indipendently. The project has been conducted in Google Colab, and all notebooks contain a direct Colab badge.
