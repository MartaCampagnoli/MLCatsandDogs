This project has been divided in three notebooks. The core of the work is contained in the "K-fold" notebook, containing xxx experiments ran using 5-fold cross validation on 3 different architectures, the " " notebook reports 19 training experiments on 9 different network architectures, and " " is an additional notebook where images and network structure are visualized. Since the " " notebook contains the experiments conducted to select a subset of models to use for training with 5-fold cross validation, the " " notebook, which responds to the necessity of the work having a more limited running time, can be run indipendently.
